# CLAUDE.md

This file contains project-specific information for Claude Code.

## Project Overview
Direct 3D Playground - A toy graphics engine built with Direct3D for learning and experimentation.

### Core Features
- Adjustable frame pacing/timing control
- 2D shape rendering primitives
- Shader pipeline integration and management

## Development Commands
<!-- Add build, run, and test commands here -->

## Project Structure

Rules
	- Every new file should go to a non-root folder

## Graphics Pipeline Notes
- Using Direct3D for hardware-accelerated rendering
- Focus on 2D primitives as foundation before 3D features
- Modular shader system for flexibility

## TODOs
- [ ] Refactor Main.cpp
- [ ] - [ ] Implement frame timing/pacing system
- [ ] Create basic 2D shape primitives (rectangles, circles, lines)
- [ ] Build shader loading and compilation pipeline
- [ ] Add input handling for interactive demos
